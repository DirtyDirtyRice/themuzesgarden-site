# The Muzes Garden DAW - Development Status

Last updated: August 13, 2026

## Current objective

Build a credible professional DAW that musicians can use in a closed beta, while preserving the original AI-assisted and historical-ledger vision. Work proceeds by complete milestones: implementation, focused tests, production build, commit, push, and this status update.

## Latest completed milestone - Normalization Support Operations Audit and Export

The complete normalization support lifecycle is now independently reviewable and portable.

- Versioned checksum-protected audit exports spanning cases, lifecycle history, notifications, escalations, and reconciliation receipts.
- Strict schema and checksum validation with local read-only inspection.
- Server-side case, priority, event, date-range, and page filters.
- Deterministic completeness checks flag missing creation receipts and broken case references.
- Owner-controlled export revocation receipts preserve all underlying audit history.
- Compact totals for open cases, overdue cases, pending notifications, and cleaned payloads.
- Metadata-only CSV export excludes diagnostic bundles and private audio.
- Immutable export issuance records store checksum, schema, counts, completeness, and findings.

### Verification

- Focused audit, notification, and automation tests passed (8 tests).
- TypeScript validation passed.
- Next.js production build passed.
- Supabase migration 20260814113000 applied successfully.
- Existing code-map warning remains non-blocking and unrelated.

## Previously completed DAW foundation

- Durable DAW workspaces and authenticated project sessions.
- Timeline transport and playback foundations.
- PCM WAV render worker and live render execution.
- Private render-artifact persistence.
- Stem ZIP export delivery.
- Durable interchange delivery.
- Recovery checkpoints.
- Device and latency diagnostics.
- Live WAV and MP3 recording.
- Private recording-take persistence and management.
- Private take audition.
- AudioWorklet recording capture with compatibility fallback.
- Input-level and clipping safety.
- Preferred-take selection.
- Recording take review, notes, ratings, and renaming.
- Durable non-destructive take comp recipes and ordered preview.
- Sample-accurate comp WAV rendering and private delivery.
- Checksum-verified comp promotion with durable source provenance.
- Durable transport-synchronized private audio source lanes.
- Persistent private-lane mute, solo, gain, pan, and metering.
- Durable frame-normalized lane fades and automatic compatible equal-power crossfades.
- Atomic sample-aligned lane splits with continuous non-destructive region boundaries.
- Checksum-cached private waveforms with timeline-proportional direct region editing.
- Durable private-lane edit receipts with atomic conflict-aware undo and redo.
- Explicit multi-region selection with atomic reversible move, mixer, and fade edits.
- Timeline comments and review workflow with sample-addressed threads and transport-linked audition.
- Immutable versioned session snapshots with structural compare, A/B audition, and guarded restore.
- Sample-aligned clip gain envelopes and non-destructive spectral repair recipes.
- Persistent MIDI sequencing, controller events, quantization, virtual-instrument preview, SMF export, and snapshot coverage.
- Related-version alignment, private A/B comparison, timeline review decisions, and reversible alignment history.
- Punch-range, tempo-aware count-in, and grouped multi-pass loop recording.
- Reproducible checksum-pinned creative song experiments with private WAV/MP3 renders.
- Real five-song tempo/key detection, normalization planning, local before/after auditions, and proof mixing.
- Authenticated normalization review revisions and promotion into durable private DAW lanes.

## Next milestone - Normalization Support Audit Repair and Evidence Chain

Make audit completeness findings actionable without rewriting immutable records.

Planned outcome:

1. Add repair plans for missing receipts and broken references with dry-run previews.
2. Add owner-confirmed append-only repair receipts and explicit provenance.
3. Add hash chaining across audit export, revocation, and repair events.
4. Add before-and-after completeness comparison and repaired-case filters.
5. Add conflict checks so stale repair plans cannot be applied.
6. Add downloadable repair evidence packages without diagnostic payload duplication.
7. Run focused tests, production build, reviewed migration, commit, and push.

## Working rules

- Preserve existing architecture and user data.
- Work one file at a time and keep each completed milestone build-green.
- No placeholders, TODOs, or nonfunctional buttons.
- Prefer reusable engine and policy code over page-specific logic.
- Use focused tests during implementation and one full production build before pushing.
- Commit and push only milestone-related files; leave unrelated user documents and temporary files untouched.
- Push completed milestone commits autonomously; do not ask the user to approve routine pushes.
- Update this file at the end of every milestone.

## Resume instruction

Start a new Codex task and say:

> Read `DAW-STATUS.md` and complete the next DAW milestone autonomously. Work one file at a time, run focused tests, run the full production build, apply any reviewed migration, commit, push without asking for routine push approval, and update `DAW-STATUS.md`.
